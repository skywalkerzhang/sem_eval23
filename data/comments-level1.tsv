A27031	W034	Have life accepted as is	Thjis is the only thing that comes close to fitting this argument.
A27031	W034	-	This is a really weak argument and nothing truly fits.
A27032	W034	Be just	This sort of fits
A27034	W034	Be helpful	This is ultimately what they're wanting to do here.
A27035	W034	-	Because it is good to protect the vulnerable
A27035	W034	Have a safe country	better defend its citizens is the only thing that really follows this argument.
A27071	W036	-	The argument deals with the cost to society
A27074	W036	-	Having no debts is directly referred to tin the argument
A27077	W034	Be just	This would fall under the protecting the weak and vulnerable children
A27077	W034	-	The best justification I can think of is: Because it is good to protect our children.
A27078	W034	Be broadminded	 their focus is very narrow.
A27078	W034	Have an objective view	This fits if you consider they're not weighing all the pros and cons of using and destroying embryonic cells
A27078	W034	-	The best arguement I can think of is: Because it is good to act morally.
A27079	W034	Have no debts	homeopathic remedies have damaged many people's health.
A27121	W034	Be ambitious	 there's really NOT a good justification for this argument other than freedom of speech is being compromised in their view.
A27121	W034	Have a sense of belonging	This kind of fits this twisted narrative.better than anything else here.
A27121	W034	-	This is really just political rhetoric by Republicans against Democcrats
A27123	W034	Have a world at peace	Prostitutes are vulnerable because it's illegal
A27125	W034	Be ambitious	Because it is good to always have it available anywhere in the world
A27158	W034	Be protecting the environment	This should fit even though it's not explicitly stated.
A27159	W034	-	Because it is good to save resources?
A27159	W034	Have an objective view	There's nothing that says re-write 150 year old laws.
A27160	W034	Be responsible	This is ultimately what they want to achieve with responsible spending.
A27481	W034	-	All 4 of these seem to fit the arguement.
A27482	W034	Have freedom of action	This allows people to buy whatever clothes they can afford for their children.
A27484	W034	Be ambitious	 collectivism has several different meanings for groups or doctrines
A27484	W034	Have success	 and the argument doesn't give any real details on exactly which type of collectivism it's referring to.
A27484	W034	-	I hope these are OK
A27485	W034	Be capable	 but it doesn't really fit the context here.
A27485	W034	Have success	I considered honoring elders
A28022	W034	Have good health	Bullies affect both physical & mental health.
A28056	W034	Be capable	It would help journalists to be more capable in their coverage of our government.
A28059	W034	-	This makes no sense at all.  An austerity regime should have the oppisite effect since the government would control their spending resulting in less taxation.
A28060	W034	Be ambitious	 churches and medical offices don't exist for the purpose of being a safe space for people to get away from their opressors.
A28060	W034	-	This argument seems way off-key
A28156	W034	Have equality	This speaks directly to poorer people.
A28157	W034	-	There's not much context here.
A28158	W034	Be ambitious	 is it referring to Joseph Stalin Collectivist anarchism?
A28158	W034	-	There's nothing to say exactly what type of collectivism they're referring to
A28168	W028	-	be safe
A28233	W034	-	I thought targeted killing was already illegal.
A28234	W034	-	Because it is good to be paid for your work.
A28336	W034	Be helpful	This is being helpful to keep people from harming themselves with questionable treatments.
A28336	W034	Be logical	Desperate people do try to rationalize naturopathy as a valid treatment.
A28338	W034	Be choosing own goals	Thjeir goal is to change their self image of how they view themselves.
A28338	W034	Have a comfortable life	This argument says it's affecting their self image and cosmetric surgery would increase their general happiness with themselves.
A28339	W034	Be curious	TV does spark interest in a lot of different fields by exposing children to them.
A28339	W034	Be intellectual	Some television is educational which fosters intellectualism.
A28339	W034	Have freedom of thought	Banning TV would result in censorship.
A28340	W034	Be respecting traditions	The traditional practice was always exclusion of women on the battlefield.
A28341	W034	Be ambitious	 and I cannot find a single justification for it
A28341	W034	Have success	 everything here is the opposite of what they're arguing.
A28341	W034	-	This is more of a point of view statement
A28356	W034	Have good health	Fewer accidents means less death or injury.
A28382	W034	-	This doesn't make complete sense: ...by affecting a larger crowd that simply the government people.
A28385	W034	Have good health	Stress has negative effects on health.
A28492	W028	-	be moral and ethical
A31117	W034	-	Does some country actually subsidize stay at home mothers? I've never heard of such a thing.
A31208	W034	Be ambitious	 and there's zero proof that someone's being forced into a life of crime.
A31208	W034	-	This argument is really out-there
A31210	W034	Be ambitious	This is another really weak argument without merit.
A31275	W029	-	4
A31390	W034	-	What does the weather have to do with a subsidy?
A31416	W034	-	Does this mean they want to close Guantanamo Bay and kill all the prisoners instead?
A31419	W034	Be compliant	This is apparently a bad thing according to the argument.
A31419	W034	-	This doesn't make a lot of sense... If you end affirmative action then companies wouldn't tneed to hire ANY minorities to be compliant!  There's no law that says they ever need to exceed their quota!
A31433	W034	-	Because it's good to save tax payers money!
A31436	W034	Be just	Because we don't subsidize stay at home moms either!
A32021	W037	-	it is good to have fast means of transportation
A32026	W037	-	it is good to have regulations
A32027	W037	-	it is good to use what you have (time)
A32029	W037	-	it is good to mitigate risk
A32045	W037	-	it is good to live in a safe place
A32067	W037	-	it is good to be scientific
A32072	W037	-	it is good to be diverse
A32112	W037	-	it is good to be scientific
A32114	W034	-	They don'ty seem to know the difference between private and public.
A32114	W037	-	it is good to be consistent
A32136	W037	-	it is good to protect the weak from the strong
A32137	W037	-	it is good to be progressive
A32146	W037	-	it is good to be modern
A32150	W037	-	it is good to be modernized
A32171	W034	Be ambitious	 and terrorists fall outside of the norms of a normal human being... They're not there by accident.
A32171	W034	-	This argument is one of the hardest to rate since the detainees are terrorists
A32196	W034	-	Because it is good to save taxpayers money!
A32196	W034	Be responsible	be responsible with taxpayers money.
A32223	W037	-	it is good to keep up with the times
A32252	W037	-	it is good to do things with purpose
A32255	W037	-	it is good to mitigate risks
A32279	W034	-	Affirmative action has NOTHING to do with someone's background and neverything to do with ntheir race or skin color.
A32288	W037	-	it is good to be positive
A32306	W034	Be compliant	I guess
A32306	W034	Be self-disciplined	 although I still don't have a real clue as to what this argument is supposed to mean.
A32306	W034	-	This doesn't make any sense.  Do they not understand what polyygamy is?  And why would anyone not be able to go elsewhere and hoiw would that stop a sexual predator?
A32339	W034	Be ambitious	 and what kind of disadvantages do they possess?  I don't know what they're trying to argue here.
A32339	W034	-	What exactly are clever people
A32343	W034	Be ambitious	 between the typographical errors and the scattered thought pattern
A32343	W034	Have success	 it's not a coherent argument.
A32343	W034	-	I'm not completely sure I can follow exactly what they're trying to say
A32344	W034	Be capable	 OK
A32344	W034	Be intellectual	 let's monetize it!
A32344	W034	Have success	Forget about the fact that it's a U.S. Naval base where civilians aren't allowed to go... But
A32356	W034	Be ambitious	 in fact it's much harder to fire a minority
A32356	W034	Be capable	 so they ARE being hired because of how they look!
A32356	W034	Be protecting the environment	This argument is so badly composed
A32356	W034	Have harmony with nature	 but I think this is their justification most likely.
A32356	W034	Have success	 and their ONLY requirement is their skin color
A32356	W034	-	This is a really badly formed argument and it desen't make any sense... Affirmative action has absolutely nothing to do with how someone performs their work
A32357	W034	Be compliant	A strong role model and good values leads to responsibility!
A32357	W034	Be honest	The government is more capable if they're not subsidizing everyone.
A32357	W034	Be intellectual	Finally! A voice of reason argument!
A32358	W034	Be courageous	 if you remove all distinctions of ethnicity
A32358	W034	Be helpful	 then it's no longer a multicultural society and everyone is exactly the same culture and color or a monoculture.
A32358	W034	Be intellectual	This isn't a very strong argument
A32359	W034	Be helpful	This argument is hysterical! I almost died laughing! Too bad they couldn't spell polygamy.
A32425	W028	Have loyalty towards friends	I would suggest deleting towards friends because have loyalty is broadly applicable to many situations.
A32432	W034	Be ambitious	 it's abandoned for any person that doesn't agree with it!
A32432	W034	-	This is such a bizarre argument... If they don't agree with marriage then don't get married! There
A32432	W037	-	it is good to be modern
A32433	W034	Be ambitious	Somebody clearly doesn't have a good grasp of the English language
A32433	W034	Be capable	 and this entire argument doesn't make any sense
A32433	W034	Be courageous	 this argument is actually more AGAINST ending affirmative action and its principal motives.
A32433	W034	Be intellectual	 especially since it has nothing to do with affirmative action. Therefore
A32433	W034	Have success	 or know how to write a coherent sentence
A32433	W037	-	The English on this one is quite broken.
A32435	W034	Be courageous	This is extremely short-sighted thinking. So
A32435	W034	Be forgiving	 the government goes bankrupt.
A32435	W034	Be helpful	 if both parents decide to stay at home since they're living-off of government subsidies
A32435	W034	Be honest	 who is ever going to work to be able to pay taxes to enable the government to be able to pass-out free money to anyone that wants to stay at home to raise their children? Then
A32450	W034	Be ambitious	 this particular argument is against almost every other justification listed.
A32450	W034	-	We need: Because it is good to not get killed!  Otherwise
A32473	W037	-	it is good to avoid overpopulation
B02007	W034	-	Because it is good to not be wasteful.
B02007	W037	-	it is good to avoid waste
B02010	W034	-	Because it is good to not be wasteful.
B02010	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to be resourceful
B02010	W037	-	it is good to avoid waste
B02014	W037	-	it is good to be trustworthy
B02015	W037	-	it is good to be accessible
B02022	W037	-	it is good to be modern
B02027	W037	-	it is good to have peace and quiet
B02036	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to have a meritocracy
B02036	W037	-	it is good to be consistent
B02084	W034	-	0
B02085	W034	Have good health	Mental health
B03022	W034	-	0
B03025	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to learn from others
B03025	W037	-	it is good to explore alternative solutions
B03029	W037	-	it is good to modernize
B03042	W037	-	it is good to have ease of access
B03052	W037	-	it is good to respect the majority
B03053	W037	-	it is good to consider others
E01006	W034	-	The exact same argument can be made for booth nuclear or renewable energy sources.
E01009	W033	Be ambitious	 not against.
E01009	W033	-	I think this argument is for the statement
E01009	W034	Be ambitious	 it's FOR!
E01009	W034	Be logical	 which is what it's supposed to be.
E01009	W034	Have a world of beauty	 but it's not against it
E01009	W034	Have harmony with nature	This fits the second line
E01009	W034	-	This argument makes no sense... It isn't against the statement
E01010	W034	Be capable	This is really ambiguous... Our consumption habits of what kind of throw away products? Electronics? Plastics? What types of mass-produced foods?  What kind of problems? Health? Environment? I took some big guesses here.
E01062	W034	-	Consumption of what exactly?
E01062	W034	Have good health	It they're referring to food.
E01063	W034	-	Again
E01063	W034	Be ambitious	 is theis talking about food? Social media? Consumer goods?
E01095	W037	Be ambitious	 neither agreeing nor disagreeing.
E01095	W037	-	This one was hard because I am not sure there is much of a viewpoint here
E01135	W029	-	1
E02073	W034	Be ambitious	 not against it.
E02073	W034	-	This doesn't make sense. The argument is actually FOR
E03028	W034	Be responsible	Be responsible with their budget.
E04018	W034	Be ambitious	 or maybe it's supposed to be a justification for being illegally there.
E04018	W034	-	This argument sounds much more like it's FOR than against
E04021	W034	Be ambitious	 over 60% is under 25 years old
E04021	W034	Have success	 what does a migration policy have to do with their declining child mortality rate that's actually more responsibile for their youth population?
E04021	W034	-	I don't have a clue how to justify this argument.  Africa has the youngest population in the world
E04022	W034	Be capable	 it doesn't make sense to me.
E04022	W034	Have success	I still don't see how this is caused by a migration policy
E04030	W028	-	Argument makes no sense.
E04056	W037	-	it is good to be loyal to your country
E04064	W037	-	it is good to be safe
E04074	W037	-	it is good to be progressive
E04091	W037	Be ambitious	 apologies
E04091	W037	-	I am having a hard time finding a good category for this one
E04126	W037	-	it is good to encourage growth in other countries
E04130	W037	-	it is good to be selective
E04136	W034	Be ambitious	 so
E04136	W034	Be capable	 the members would simply refuse everyone because it's too costly to allow immigration.
E04136	W034	Have success	 to save a ton of money
E04136	W034	-	This is an extremely liberal position that would really cost the taxpayers
E04138	W034	Be capable	I really don't see the logic in this argument
E04138	W034	Be intellectual	 there's not enough context.
E04140	W034	Be courageous	 if something's illegal then it's automatically blocked until it's mad to be legal...
E04140	W034	Be intellectual	Doesn't illegal migration alrerady mean it's ILLEGAL and therefore
E04153	W037	-	it is good to be transparent
E05005	W034	-	Because government transparancy is good!
E05054	W034	-	Because it is good to be transparent
E05055	W034	-	Because it is good to have a strong council
E05141	W037	-	I am not sure exactly what the argument is. It does not seem to have a stance.
E05142	W034	Be ambitious	 but it doesn't actually mention any kind of religon
E05142	W034	Have success	 so I didn't think it was appropriate to select it.
E05142	W034	-	This is a really broad statement
E05143	W034	Be courageous	This should result in a higher effectivity.
E05144	W034	Have success	This isn't as much of an argument as it is a political speech... and it's beyond confusing since it constantly goes into a whole other diatribe about UBI and other wishful thinking. My head is spinning!
E05145	W034	Be courageous	Capable instead of incompetence!
E05145	W034	Be independent	It really sounds like this is trying to gain financial prosperity for the EU.
E05154	W034	-	Another pie-in-the-sky liberal that can't even spell bus FARE! Yet they supposedly had plenty of money to spend in the shops? Just how much is bus fare? And the only way it could be free is by raising taxes on everyone!
E05155	W037	-	it is good to avoid waste
E06003	W037	-	it is good to protect the unborn
E06004	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to protect the unborn
E06004	W037	-	it is good to be consistent
E06035	W034	-	This is a tough one because it's more of a sound-bite than anything else.
E06069	W034	Be independent	career or children.
E07020	W037	-	it is good to promote democracy
E07022	W037	-	it is good to listen to natives.
E07028	W037	-	it is good to award things based on merit
E07029	W037	-	it is good to be competitive
E07034	W037	-	it is good to plan for the future
E07035	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to support neighbors
E07035	W037	-	it is good to plan for the future
E07036	W034	Have a sense of belonging	Arabs immigrating to other Arab countries.
E07038	W034	-	There's not enough context here to really understand his position here.
E07053	W035	-	=
E07079	W037	-	it is good to show strength
E07081	W037	Be ambitious	 stating are you insane
E07081	W037	-	I am confused by the ending of this sentence
E07082	W037	Be ambitious	it is good to be careful when aiding other countries
E07084	W037	Be ambitious	it is good to support other countries
E07094	W034	-	I don't think I completely understand what they're arguing here.
E07094	W037	-	it is good to put your money where your mouth is
E07095	W037	-	it is good to listen to your constituents.
E07110	W037	-	it is good to cooperate
E07113	W037	-	it is good to learn from the past
E07128	W034	Have a sense of belonging	fewer people forced to leave their groups
E07128	W034	Have the own family secured	Because it is good to have more children.
E07128	W034	-	This is a weird argument... How do you stop people from dying of natural causes or old age or incurable disease or pandemic? Can you force people to make more babies? Maybe open the borders for more migration?
E07133	W037	-	it is good to let things play out
E07149	W037	-	it is good to be united
E07163	W037	-	it is good to cooperate

E07246	W037	-	it is good to have loyalty to one's homeland.
E07247	W037	-	it is good to contribute
E07252	W037	-	I am not sure what the person is trying to convey here.
E07258	W037	-	it is good to update policies as needed
E07259	W037	-	it is good to import intelligent people
E07275	W037	-	it is good to cooperate with others
E07276	W037	-	it is good to adapt to change

E08018	W034	-	0
E08023	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to sacrifice for the greater good
E08023	W037	-	it is good to be thankful
F01002	W034	-	0
F01004	W034	Be ambitious	 not against it.  It's just stating another way that habitual greed DOES devalue humans and it does not make a case for being against it.
F01004	W034	-	This is clearly an argument FOR Habitual greed devalues humans
F01008	W034	-	0
F01026	W037	-	it is good to judge someone by their actions rather than their appearance
F01027	W037	-	it is good to be perceptive
F01028	W037	-	it is good to be reserved
F01029	W037	-	it is good to be reserved
F01032	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to be careful with your words
F01032	W037	-	it is good to be silent
F01034	W037	Be ambitious	it is good to be quiet
F01037	W034	-	This wording is difficult to decypher exactly what their point is!
F01047	W037	-	it is good to know the gravity of our actions
F01048	W037	-	it is good to move on from simple mistakes
F01049	W037	Be ambitious	 it is good to sacrifice comfort for intelligence
F01049	W037	-	it is good to be around intelligent people
F01051	W034	-	0
F01056	W034	Be ambitious	 so that's what I'm going to rate this argument on.
F01056	W034	-	I really think they're referring to the verb: envies instead of the adjective: envious. Maybe this is a bad English translation? The only word that makes sense is envies
F01056	W037	-	This one does not make a lot of sense to me.
F01060	W034	Be ambitious	This last line showing grace destroys the reward of good deeds doesn't really make sense
F01060	W034	Have success	 maybe it's a translation problem? Maybe the word grace has a completely different meaning thousands of years later?
F01067	W037	-	it is good to have self-worth
F01073	W037	-	it is good to be calm
F01084	W034	Be ambitious	 but then they're only talking about the singular people that close their heart to the world
F01084	W034	Have success	 It's extremely confusing trying to read between the lines of their reasoning.
F01084	W034	-	This argument is really bizarre... The statement world is reprehensible refers to the entire world
F01085	W034	Be capable	 but I tried!
F01085	W034	Have success	I don't know exactly what this is supposed to mean
F01097	W034	Have loyalty towards friends	I'm not completely sure because Losing friends is homelessness doesn't exactly make sense.
